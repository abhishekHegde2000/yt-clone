Youtube - Clone 

 

Steps - - 

Npx create-react-app youtube-clone 

 

npm install -D tailwindcss 

npx tailwindcss init  

 

Configure path – config tailwind 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ 

module.exports = { 

  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"], 

  theme: { 

    extend: {}, 

  }, 

  plugins: [], 

} 

--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Index.file -  

@tailwind base; 

@tailwind components; 

@tailwind utilities; 

 

 

<React.StrictMode> is a development mode feature in React that helps with identifying potential problems in the application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. It is not a component that renders anything, but rather a tool that highlights potential issues in the code. It is recommended to use it during development and testing, but not in production. 

 

 

Machine coding interview – requirements clarification .  

We have to ask interviewr about the features we need to build. 

Ask about tech stack – what are techs we will use – like tailwind or css. Redux or use State? 

Next 5 mins in planning things – low level design . Discuss your approach.  

 

 

 

 

After this you have to say which cmd u would use , I use npx create-react-app. 

 

reportWebVitals is a function that is used to report performance metrics of a web page to a third-party service or to the developer's own analytics system. 

 

 

 

 

Now I want to write a functionality where if I click on menu bar button the side bar should toggle. 

How to build this?? 
 

Using use state??  

And example -  

import React, { useState } from 'react'; 

const App = () => { 

  const [sidebarVisible, setSidebarVisible] = useState(false); 

  const toggleSidebar = () => { 

    setSidebarVisible(!sidebarVisible); 

  }; 

  return ( 

    <div className="flex"> 

      <div className={`sidebar ${sidebarVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}`}> 

        {/* Sidebar content */} 

      </div> 

      <div className="content"> 

        <button onClick={toggleSidebar}>Toggle Sidebar</button> 

        {/* Main content */} 

      </div> 

    </div> 

  ); 

}; 

export default App; 

But we wont use this because we need to think big and we r building utube with many functionalities.  

So we can build a it using redux store. 

Npm Install @reduxjs/toolkit      and npm I react-redux                                                                                                                                                     

Using Redux : 

First thing I have to do is --- > create redux Store – it’s a central repository system where can store the data . And inside the store there will be many slices of perticular data. 

Create redux store 

Create this in utils .  

It will be created with configureStore. 

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; 

 

const store = configureStore({ 

 

}); 

export default store; 

 

Create Slice 

Create a slice with api – createSlice :  

This takes in parameter name , initialstate , reducers 

Inside reducers – there are states and actions through which we can manipulate data. 

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; 

 

const appSlice = createSlice({ 

  name: "app", 

  initialState: { 

    isMenuOpen: true, 

  }, 

  reducers: { 

    toggleMenu: (state) => { 

      state.isMenuOpen = !state.isMenuOpen; 

    }, 

    closeMenu: (state) => { 

      state.isMenuOpen = false; 

    }, 

  }, 

}); 

 

export const { toggleMenu, closeMenu } = appSlice.actions; 

export default appSlice.reducer; 

 

 

Once I created the slice import in into store. 

 

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; 

import appSlice from "./appSlice"; 

const store = configureStore({ 

  reducer: { 

    app: appSlice, 

  }, 

}); 

export default store; 

 

    3) Give Provider to app.js 

Once you do this , we need to go back into the app.js and we need to provide our store to it. 

To do that wrap the main div with <provider store  = {appStore}> 

Need to import appStore from utils. 

function App() { 

  return ( 

    <Provider store={store}> 

      <div> 

        <Head/> 

        <Body/> 

      </div> 

    </Provider> 

  ); 

} 

export default App; 

 

 

Once we are done with these steps we can check in the redux extension , if the states are visible or not (initial state set to true) 

If it it these then uits working fine.
